**Code design: **
I aimed to adhere strictly to the SOLID principles in designing the project, utilizing Extenject (Zenject) to facilitate this adherence. I am also a strong proponent of the KISS principle, striving to implement it as effectively as possible.

The game initializes from a boot scene where I bind the GameManager and signals within the project context, in addition to loading and binding the addressables from Unity Cloud. I was not entirely satisfied with how I currently bind the addressables by accessing the project context's DiContainer, but time constraints prevented me from coming up with a better approach.

In the game scene I use Factories and memory pools for managing dynamic elements such as asteroids, bullets, and UICoins. With an eye toward future collaboration, I organized the UI components as prefabs that are instantiated during the binding process. This setup wasn't just about streamlining my workflowâ€”it was also about laying the groundwork for seamless teamwork with designers. By preparing these prefabs, I aimed to create an environment where, should the opportunity for collaboration arise, designers could easily dive in and contribute, working on these elements independently.

The game operates on a state-driven model, with simple events triggered by the GameManager. Currently, when the player dies, the game scene simply reloads.

The player is decoupled with several different classes each handling a specific topic in order to adhere to the single responsibility principle. 

**Decisions and challenges:**
- Opting for Extenject (Zenject) was a deliberate choice despite my lack of prior experience with it. The initial learning phase was somewhat slow, yet as I grew more familiar with its features, my appreciation for it deepened. It has reached a point where I envision using it for all my personal projects going forward. Although the learning curve initially slowed my progress, the investment has proven worthwhile.

- Unit Tests: Unfortunately, I did not incorporate unit tests in my project. However, after researching the topic extensively, I recognize their value and plan to integrate them into my future projects regularly.

- Addressables: Having previous experience with addressables, I was able to implement them relatively quickly. Currently, I am storing three assets with addressables but only utilize two, as I did not prioritize integrating audio into the game.

- Visual effects: As I've worked quite a lot with shaders I had quite a few ideas on cool effects to implement but I ended up not writing any shader code at all, I dont even have a flashing effect on the player when it takes damage. I felt like it was more important to focus solely on a clean codebase than making the game look good and I'm somewhat happy about the result in the time given.
